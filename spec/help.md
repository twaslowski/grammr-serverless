I will soon release this project in an MVP mode. It will be used by a lot of people.
I want to gather feedback as quickly as possible.
Therefore, I'm looking to build a Help page. This help page should make it possible for users to:
1. Go through a FAQ
2. Submit feedback
3. Reach out with questions

Some questions I anticipate to get frequently is:
- Can you integrate X language?
- Can you implement X feature?
- How do I do X?

I would like to give a quick

Additionally, I think having a small "report error" or "report bug" button present specifically
in the translation or inflection pages that can collect some of the current context alongside a quick
user comment might be very helpful.
Create a hovering button that opens a dialog that allows users to quickly submit feedback on errors.
